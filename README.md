# Least-Cost Path Network & Circuit Theory - Comparison
R code used for the output comparison of the <a href="https://github.com/gdomrib/landscape_connectivity"> landscape_connectivity QGIS plugin</a>. It provides statistical tests and meaningful graphs to check the differences between both approaches to modelling landscape mobility.

The values for each method were calculated in QGIS as follows:
- <b> LCP Network </b>: distance to the nearest hub tool.
- <b> Circuit theory </b>: zonal statistics plugin. Mean value of a 3 km buffer around each site.


The site locations used for the comparison are available in the following <a href="https://github.com/xrubio/models/blob/master/changesLBA_EIA/data.csv">link</a>.
